# crux-toolchain-arm-linux-gnueabi

CRUX-ARM Toolchain using the "new" ABI (EABI), supported on armv4t and higher

> IMPORTANT NOTE:
>
> This toolchain is marked as obsolete and was developed using a CRUX system as a host whose version matches the version of CRUX-ARM to be generated.
> That is, to compile version 2.8 of this toolchain, you will need, ideally, a
> CRUX 2.8 host, otherwise it is very likely that you will get compilation errors, especially with recent compilers.
